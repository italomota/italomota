I am a software developer, bachelor in Computer Science from the Federal University of Sergipe, working in the area since 2014. I started as a fullstack developer, however since the year 2018 until then I have kept focus on the mobile stack that I fell in love with and I have deepened more each day.

I work with React Native, always looking to develop applications with high code quality and performance.
